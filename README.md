# README
Important note: this app is solely here to help me learn ruby on rails, it is NOT to be used for production

How to navigate this app:
 1. THe main menu gives an option to view mock Courses, like you would see on a university course website, or students in the database.
 2. If you choose the students, you will have to search for a specfic student by name.
 3. The student portal allows all CRUD operations, plus the ability for students to view their courses, and their own email boxes (also with CRUD operations)
 3. Students can also search for courses, and enroll/drop them
 4. The course portal allows all CRUD operations, plus the ability to view all students enrolled in them. They also keep track of being full/manage their own waitlist

 This app is a work in progress, and this README will be updated as I add features :)
